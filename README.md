A romantic, animated New Year wish website.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Website**:
    Since you might face PowerShell restriction issues, run the included batch file:
    ```bash
    .\run_app.bat
    ```
    Or manually run:
    ```bash
    cmd /c "npm run dev"
    ```
    Then open the link shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Customization

-   **Music**: Replace the URL in `src/components/MusicPlayer.jsx` with your own mp3 link or file.
-   **Photos**: You can add photos to the `Memories` section by editing `src/components/Memories.jsx`.
